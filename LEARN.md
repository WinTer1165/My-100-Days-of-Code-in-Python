# My-100-Days-of-Code-in-Python
I am trying to give 2-3 hours everyday to get one step closer to my goal of learning python. But due to my laziness I can't keep up and losing motivations. :(

I am using VS Code to write my code and sometimes, I use Thonny to debug/check my cracks in code. 











Can't think of anything to write here now. (30 JUN 2022)
