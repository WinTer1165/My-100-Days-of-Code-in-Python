# My-100-Days-of-Code-in-Python
I have been learning python recently from udemy(https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). Dr. Angela is a great instructor and she is really providing quality education. 

I will try to update new projects that I learn every week. Welp, I am too lazy, I don't even know when I will be able to finish it ;)

##Update 01:
I have been been lazy recently and couldn't continue my course :p . I have completed upto day 7. I learned about looping, conditions and some functions.
##Update 02: 10 JUN 2022
I have completed day 8 and learned about functions.
